# TypeScript Function Cardio

For each of the exercises you will find a function written in JavaScript. Your task is to add the appropriate TypeScript types.

Your objective is to:

- Ensure that the valid code examples pass the TypeScript compiler without any errors

- Make sure the code examples marked with `//@ts-expect-error` correctly trigger a TypeScript error.

You will need to replace the any types with more specific and appropriate types.
