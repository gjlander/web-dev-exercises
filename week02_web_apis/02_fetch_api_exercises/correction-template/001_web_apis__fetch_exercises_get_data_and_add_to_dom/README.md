GET data and add to DOM
=======================

**Objective:**

Learn how to fetch data from an API and display it on a webpage using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

**Instructions:**

*   **Fetch Data**: Write JavaScript to fetch todos from the JSON Placeholder API, we want the ToDos endpoint, [you can find more about the API docs in here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
*   **Display Data:** Populate the DOM with the fetched todos. Pay attention to the completed status of each task in the response and style it accordingly!

  
**JSON Placeholder API**: A free online REST API that you can use for testing and prototyping.Â 

This exercise should give you a good understanding of how to work with APIs and dynamically update the DOM with JavaScript. Happy coding!
