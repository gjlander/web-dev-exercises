// Selecting elements
// ==================

// #### Objective

// In this exercise, you will practice using the DOM API to interact with a simple HTML page. You'll select elements, log them to the console, modify their styles, and add content dynamically.

// All the instructions are supposed to be implemented from within the JavaScript file, yes you could do it from the CSS one but where's the fun in that?

// ### Instructions

// 1.  **Select Elements and Log to Console**:

//     *   Select the `h1` element inside the `.hero-content` div and log it to the console.
//     *   Select all the `a` elements inside the `.nav-list` and log them to the console.
//     *   Select the `.btn` element and log it to the console.
// 2.  **Modify Styles**:

//     *   Change the background color of the `.header` element to `#b5651d`.
//     *   Change the font size of the `h1` element inside the `.hero-content` div to `3rem`.
//     *   Change the text color of all `a` elements inside the `.nav-list` to `#faf0e6`.
// 3.  **Add Content**:

//     *   Select the `.hero-content` div and add a new `p` element with the text "Open daily from 7 AM to 9 PM." inside it.
