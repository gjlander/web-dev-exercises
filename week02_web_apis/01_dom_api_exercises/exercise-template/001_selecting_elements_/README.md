Selecting elements
==================

#### Objective

In this exercise, you will practice using the DOM API to interact with a simple HTML page. You'll select elements, log them to the console, modify their styles, and add content dynamically.

All the instructions are supposed to be implemented from within the JavaScript file, yes you could do it from the CSS one but where's the fun in that?

### Instructions

1.  **Select Elements and Log to Console**:
    
    *   Select the `h1` element inside the `.hero-content` div and log it to the console.
    *   Select all the `a` elements inside the `.nav-list` and log them to the console.
    *   Select the `.btn` element and log it to the console.
2.  **Modify Styles**:
    
    *   Change the background color of the `.header` element to `#b5651d`.
    *   Change the font size of the `h1` element inside the `.hero-content` div to `3rem`.
    *   Change the text color of all `a` elements inside the `.nav-list` to `#faf0e6`.
3.  **Add Content**:
    
    *   Select the `.hero-content` div and add a new `p` element with the text "Open daily from 7 AM to 9 PM." inside it.
