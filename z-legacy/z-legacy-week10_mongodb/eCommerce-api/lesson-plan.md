# Mongoose with Express

- It's going to be very similar to working with Sequelize

## Zod schemas

- I added actual body validation logic to the skeleton from the last lecture
- Walk through schemas

## Migrating to Mongoose

- I can delete `pg` and `sequelize` from dependencies
- `npm i mongoose`
  - Unlike sequelize, Mongoose includes the driver as well, since it only connects to one database
- Let's delete our `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` to clear out `pg` and `sequelize`
  - then run `npm i` to install them all again

### Database connection

- We can delete `associations.js`
- In `index.js`, let's copy the code snippet from the tutorial, and break it down
  - We import the `mongoose` object
  - Because we are using ES6 modules, we can use top-level await
  - We await the connection, and catch and log the error if one happens
  - Note we're not exporting anything anymore

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

try {
  await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
  console.log('MongoDB connected');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

- In our root `index.js` we import the whole file, just as before, so that the file will run and establish our connection

```js
import './db/index.js';
```

- From here we need to update our `.env` file

  - Get the connection string from Mongo Compass
  - The connection string will put us in a `test` database, so we can simply add the database we want to the end

- Now if we try to `npm run dev` it will get mad, since we need to update the controllers, but if we comment them out for new, we can see in our console logs that we do have a database connection
- Unlike Sequelize, Mongoose won't make a collection until we actually try to query it
  - show in Mongo Compass

### Updating to mongoose models

#### User model

- Next we need to update our `User` model
- Update our imports

```js
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';
```

- With Mongoose, we first define the schema by making a new instance of the `Schema` class
  - just one argument, which is the object defining the shape of our schema

```js
const userSchema = new Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  lastName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  email: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  }
});
```

- The syntax is slightly different, but same principle, we define a `type`, and want to make it `NOT NULL` or `required`

```js
firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
```

- We can also pass a custom error message

```js
firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'First name is required']
  }

```

- Last name will look the same

```js
  lastName: { type: String, required: [true, 'Last name is required'] },
```

- We can also require a property to be unique

```js
email: { type: String, required: [true, 'Email is required'], unique: true },
```

- Mongoose doesn't add timestamps by default, so we can either add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` properties, or simply add a second optional argument to add timestamps

```js
{
  timestamps: true;
}
```

- To turn this schema into an actual model, we have to pass it to the `model` function, and here is where we will name the collection that will use this model
  - We could store it in a variable, or simply export it by default

```js
export default model('User', userSchema);
```

### Update our controllers

- No longer need `Duck` model

#### `getUsers`

- replace `findAll` with `find`

```js
export const getUsers = async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.find();
  res.json(users);
};
```

- Uncomment the router and test the endpoint

#### `createUser`

- Body validation is still handled by Zod in our middleware
- If body validation check passes, we can add a check to make sure that email doesn't already exist
- method still called `create`
- Can either pass whole sanitized body, or individual properties

```js
export const createUser = async (req, res) => {
  const {
    sanitizedBody: { firstName, lastName, email }
  } = req;

  const found = await User.findOne({ email });

  if (found) throw new Error('Email already exists', { cause: 400 });

  const user = await User.create(req.sanitizedBody);

  res.json(user);
};
```

- Show it in Mongo Compass

#### If mongoose schema has unique property, why bother checking here?

- Especially since we're outside of an SQL database, if we want date consistency we really have to check for it. MongoDB doesn't care if the documents hold a certain shape, but we do. So we use Mongoose, but also Zod and other validation checks
- Mongoose is our last line of defense, but ideally no request makes it that far that won't be accepted

#### `getUserById`

- `findByPK` becomes `findById`

```js
export const getUserById = async (req, res) => {
  const {
    params: { id }
  } = req;
  const user = await User.findById(id);
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found', { cause: 404 });
  res.json(user);
};
```

#### `updateUser`

- can do in one step with `findByIdAndUpdate`
- in order to get back the updated resource, have to add third argument and set `new` to `true`

```js
export const updateUser = async (req, res) => {
  const {
    sanitizedBody: { firstName, lastName, email },
    params: { id }
  } = req;

  const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(id, req.sanitizedBody, { new: true });
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found', { cause: 404 });

  res.json(user);
};
```

#### `deleteUser`

- can also move to one step

```js
export const deleteUser = async (req, res) => {
  const {
    params: { id }
  } = req;
  const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(id);

  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found', { cause: 404 });

  res.json({ message: 'User deleted' });
};
```

### Adding a reference to a Model

- Now let's update our duck model
- We can also set a `maxLength`, and give a `default`

```js
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const duckSchema = new Schema(
  {
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      maxLength: 255
    },
    imgUrl: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      maxLength: 510
    },
    quote: {
      type: String,
      default: "I'm here to help!",
      maxLength: 1000
    }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

export default model('Duck', duckSchema);
```

- There are no relationships, but we can populate data from another collection by referencing it's id

```js
owner: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
      required: [true, 'Owner is required']
    }
```

### Update duck controllers

- Can delete `User` model import

#### `getAllDucks`

- instead of `include` we now `populate` and name of the property where we stored the ref

```js
const getAllDucks = async (req, res) => {
  const ducks = await Duck.find().populate('owner');
  res.json(ducks);
};
```

#### `createDuck`

- We will need to update our Zod `duckSchema` to include an owner

```js
owner: z.string().min(1);
```

- Uncomment and test

#### Only populating certain fields

- Now on `getAllDucks`, we get all of the user info, but we can also specify which properties to include by passing a second argument to `populate`
  - simple string, separated by spaces

```js
const getAllDucks = async (req, res) => {
  const ducks = await Duck.find().populate('owner', 'firstName lastName');
  res.json(ducks);
};
```

#### `getDuckById`

```js
const getDuckById = async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  const duck = await Duck.findById(id).populate('owner', 'firstName lastName');

  if (!duck) throw new Error('Duck not found', { cause: 404 });

  res.json(duck);
};
```

#### `updateDuck`

- populate after updating

```js
const updateDuck = async (req, res) => {
  // const { userId } = req;
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { owner, name, imgUrl, quote } = req.sanitizedBody;

  const duck = await Duck.findByIdAndUpdate(id, req.sanitizedBody, { new: true });

  if (!duck) throw new Error('Duck not found', { cause: 404 });

  // if (userId !== duck.user.id) throw new Error('You are not authorized to update this duck', { cause: 403 });

  const duckWithOwner = await duck.populate('owner', 'firstName lastName');
  res.json(duckWithOwner);
};
```
