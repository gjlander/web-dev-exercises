### Create a contact form

- In your editor go to `src/pages/Contact.jsx`
- Import `sendContactForm` from `src/api/index.js`;
- Create an `action` for the form
- Within the `action`, pass the form fields to `sendContactForm`
- Disable the button and show "Sending" while the action is being executed
