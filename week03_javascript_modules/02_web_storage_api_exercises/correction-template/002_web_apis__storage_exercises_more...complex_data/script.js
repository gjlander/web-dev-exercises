// More...complex data
// ===================

// #### Objective:

// Get the value of an input field, store it in `localStorage` as an array of objects.

// #### Instructions:

// **Store data:**

// *   From the boilerplate, get the contents of the input once the form is submitted.
// *   Make sure the input is not empty before saving!
// *   For every user input, create an object with the following properties:
//     *   id: [check this out,](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID)since an UUID may not a valid CSS selector, we will remove the hyphens and prepend the prefix `task-`
//     *   content: the user input
// *   Store this value in `localStorage` as part of an array. Store the new value at the beginning of the array!
// *   Reset the form

// **Retrieve data:**

// *   Every time you hit the "Submit" button, add a new list item to the empty `ul`. Make sure the new item is at the top!
//     *   Set the id of the object as an id to the list item element, it'll come in handy.
//     *   Within the list item, add a red button that reads 'Delete'. Make it look cool! :D
//     *   Attach an event to this button on click, for now, just log the id of the item!
// *   Make sure that when the document loads, you populate the contents of your storage item into the list. You can try to add an event listener of type `load` to the window itself!

// **Delete:**

// *   Make sure that clicking on a given 'Delete' button, deletes the item from the DOM but also from the array in localStorage. Tip: use the `.filter` method

// **Reload:**

// *   Just because we can. Add an event to the `reload` button so it [reloads the preview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload). Your store data should reload too!

// **Bonus:
// **

// *   Chances are your code for creating the list items on load and new creation is VERY similar, if not the same, try to abstract it into a reusable function called `createListItem`. This approach is called [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

// **Tip:** Verify the Storage section in the browser's developer tools to make sure the data is there!
