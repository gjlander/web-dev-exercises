Arithmetic
==========

**Objective:**  
  
Write a JavaScript program that performs a series of arithmetic operations using mixed data types and prints the results to the console. You will explore how JavaScript handles operations involving both strings and numbers.

### Tasks:

1.  **Addition with Mixed Types**
    
    *   Create a variable that stores a number.
    *   Create a variable that stores a string representation of a number.
    *   Add these two variables and print the result.
    *   Explain the output.
2.  **Subtraction with Mixed Types**
    
    *   Using the same string and number variables, subtract the string from the number and print the result.
    *   Explain why the output differs from the addition.
3.  **Multiplication with a String**
    
    *   Multiply the string variable by a new number and print the result.
4.  **Division by a String**
    
    *   Divide a number by the string variable and print the result.
5.  **Modulus Operation**
    
    *   Use modulus on two number variables and print the result.
    *   Change one of the numbers to a string and perform the modulus operation again. Print the result.
6.  **Perform a Series of Numeric Operations**
    
    *   Define several new numeric variables.
    *   Perform and print the result of each operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
    *   For each operation, include at least one example that uses more than two numbers.

### Notes:

*   Consider what happens when operations are performed on different data types.
*   JavaScript performs type coercion in certain operations. Reflect on how this affects the results.
