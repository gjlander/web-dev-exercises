ForEach
=======

**Objective:**

Learn how to use theÂ `forEach` method to iterate over an array in JavaScript. This exercise will involve creating a simple array and performing operations on each element.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Initialize an Array of Numbers:**
    
    *   Create an array called `numbers` containing the following values in order: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`.
2.  **Use the `forEach` Method to Print Each Number:**
    
    *   Use the `forEach` method to iterate over `numbers` and print each number to the console.
3.  **Use the `forEach` Method to Calculate the Sum of the Numbers:**
    
    *   Initialize a variable `sum` to `0`.
    *   Use the `forEach` method to iterate over `numbers`, adding each number to `sum`.
    *   Print the final value of `sum` to the console.
4.  **Use the `forEach` Method to Create a New Array with Squared Values:**
    
    *   Create an empty array called `squaredNumbers`.
    *   Use the `forEach` method to iterate over `numbers`, squaring each number and adding the squared value to `squaredNumbers`.
    *   Print the `squaredNumbers` array to the console.
