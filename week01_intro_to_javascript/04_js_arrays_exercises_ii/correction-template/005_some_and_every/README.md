Some and Every
==============

**Objective:**

Learn how to use theÂ `some` and `every` methods to test whether some or all elements in an array pass the provided function's test in JavaScript.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Initialize an Array of Numbers:**
    
    *   Create an array called `numbers` containing the following values in order: `4`, `8`, `15`, `16`, `23`, `42`.
2.  **Use the `some` Method to Check for Numbers Greater Than 20:**
    
    *   Use the `some` method to check if there are any numbers in `numbers` that are greater than `20`.
    *   Print the result to the console (should be `true`).
3.  **Use the `every` Method to Check for Numbers Less Than 50:**
    
    *   Use the `every` method to check if all numbers in `numbers` are less than `50`.
    *   Print the result to the console (should be `true`).
4.  **Initialize an Array of Objects:**
    
    *   Create an array called `students` containing the following objects:
        *   `{ name: "Alice", age: 25, passed: true }`
        *   `{ name: "Bob", age: 22, passed: false }`
        *   `{ name: "Charlie", age: 27, passed: true }`
        *   `{ name: "David", age: 20, passed: true }`
5.  **Use the `some` Method to Check if Any Student Failed:**
    
    *   Use the `some` method to check if there are any students in `students` who have `passed` set to `false`.
    *   Print the result to the console (should be `true`).
6.  **Use the `every` Method to Check if All Students are Older Than 18:**
    
    *   Use the `every` method to check if all students in `students` are older than `18`.
    *   Print the result to the console (should be `true`).
