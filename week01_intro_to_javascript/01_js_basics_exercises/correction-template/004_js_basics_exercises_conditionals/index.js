// Conditionals
// ============

// **Objective:**

// Write JavaScript code that provides clothing advice based on the current temperature. This exercise will help you learn how to use different types of conditional statements effectively.

// #### Tasks:

// 1.  Define a variableÂ `temperature` and set it to any integer to represent the temperature in degrees Celsius.
// 2.  Use `if/else` to advise wearing a coat if the temperature is below 15 degrees.
// 3.  Use `if/else if/else` to give advice based on three temperature ranges:
//     *   Below 15 degrees: suggest a coat.
//     *   Between 15 and 25 degrees: suggest a sweater.
//     *   Above 25 degrees: suggest a t-shirt.
// 4.  Use a `switch` statement to provide advice based on specific temperatures (just a few for example): 10, 20, and 30 degrees.
// 5.  Print the results for each task to the console.

// Play with different values for `temperature` and different scenarios!
