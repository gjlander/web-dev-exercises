Reversing
=========

#### Objective:

Learn how to use the `reverse` and `toReversed` methods in JavaScript to manipulate arrays.

#### Instructions:

1.  **Reverse the First Array in Place:**
    
    *   The `reverse` method reverses the array in place, which means the original array is modified.
    *   For example, `array1.reverse()` will change `array1` from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
2.  **Create a Reversed Copy of the Second Array:**
    
    *   The `toReversed` method creates a new array that is the reversed version of the original array.
    *   This method does not modify the original array.
    *   For example, `array2.toReversed()` will return `['e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']` while `array2` remains `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`.
3.  **Print the Results:**
    
    *   Use `console.log` to print both the original and modified arrays to verify the results.
