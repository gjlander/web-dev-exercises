Loops
=====

**Objective:**

Write JavaScript code to count animals in a zoo. You will use different types of loops to count the same list of animals, helping you understand the nuances and applications of each loop type.

**Tasks:**

1.  Use a `for` loop to count the total number of animals.
2.  Use a `while` loop to count animals whose names have five or more letters. You can check the [length of a string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length)Â 
3.  Use a `do...while` loop to count animals until you encounter an animal whose name starts with 'm'

Yes, yes, we could do this with array methods! But those declarative approaches use these basic loop constructs under the hood! So we better learn them! ðŸ˜Š
