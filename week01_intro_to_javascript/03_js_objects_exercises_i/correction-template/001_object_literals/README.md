Object Literals
===============

#### Objective

Learn how to initialize an object using object literals in JavaScript and understand how to define properties and methods within an object.

#### Instructions

1.  Create an object called `book` using object literal syntax.
2.  The `book` object should have the following properties:
    *   `title`: a string representing the title of the book.
    *   `author`: a string representing the author of the book.
    *   `pages`: a number representing the total pages in the book.
    *   `isRead`: a boolean indicating if the book has been read or not.
3.  Add a method named `summary` to the `book` object. This method should return a string summarizing the book details in the format:
    *   `"Title: [title], Author: [author], Pages: [pages], Read: [Yes/No]"`.
