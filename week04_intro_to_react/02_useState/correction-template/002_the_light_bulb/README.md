The light bulb
==============

**Objective:**

Assign an event to the button so it toggles a state boolean variable. To demostrate how to conditionally render based on state.

**Instructions:**

*   Create a piece of state that represents the state of the bulb.
*   Pass the value of that state to the Lightbulb component, based on its value, render the className "container" or "container night" in its outermost div
*   Track how many times the bulb has been turned on on a separate piece of state.
    
*   Change the button label to reflect the current state ("Turn on", "Turn off", or "Locked").
    
*   Prevent the bulb from turning on after it has been activated 10 times, and show an alert instead.
    
*   Add a reset button to clear the counter and allow the bulb to be used again.
